# FIFA Player Performance Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes over 18,200 FIFA players to uncover performance trends, market value insights, and data-driven recommendations for player recruitment, scouting, and club strategy. The analysis was completed independently.

## 🎯 Business Goal

Football clubs collect extensive player performance data but often struggle to convert it into strategic decisions.
This project demonstrates how analytics can reveal:

* Top-performing players and clubs
* Market value inefficiencies
* Attributes that drive performance and value
* Age and position development trends
* Nationality-based performance strengths

## 🧠 Key Insights

* Younger players generally show higher potential.
* Belgium and Spain consistently show strong skill performance across key attributes.
* Some players deliver top performance at lower wages — indicating undervalued talent.
* Performance varies significantly by nationality and position.
* Wage and performance are not always directly correlated.

## 📊 Tools Used

* Tableau
* Excel (data cleaning)
* PowerPoint (presentation)

## 📎 Deliverables

* Interactive Tableau Dashboard
* Presentation slides
* Written insights report

## 🌐 Dataset

The dataset contains 18k+ player records including:

* Age, nationality, wage, market value
